      description: `I went to Kuala Lumpur for a week to visit Rebecca's family home and experience the culture of where she grew up!
      We had some amazing food while we were there - we tried all kinds of Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes and they were all delicious.
      I finally got to try my hand at jewellery making, which was so cool! We did 2 sessions in a workshop that they hire and i came away with 2 rings.
      We also booked a session of pottery making, which was really fun but also super frustrating. I had only done pottery once before and it's safe to say, I wasn't good at it.
      Overall, the trip was an amazing experience, it was so nice to see the culture and family that Bec comes from.`,

      It was a pleasure to meet all of their closest friends and to witness such a special occasion. However, what stood out to me the most was the unique and exciting scavenger hunt they had planned for us.
      The hunt took us all over Penang, allowing us to explore and learn about the area's history and culture. I was thrilled to be a part of the winning team and felt lucky to have had the opportunity to see so many amazing sights along the way.
      Overall, my time in Penang was a wonderful experience that I will never forget.`,

      The boat's crew provided us with delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day, making the journey even more enjoyable. During the trip, I had the chance to see some incredible sights, including the glowing algae and even swim with a massive manta ray.
      It was a thrill to see the legendary Komodo dragons in their natural habitat, although unfortunately, I did get very sunburned during the trip. On a lighter note, I was introduced to the game of Spikeball for the first time, and it turned out to be a total blast.
      All in all, my boat cruise in the Komodo National Park was a truly remarkable adventure filled with great friends, amazing experiences, and unforgettable memories.`,

      I then checked into a stunning villa with, Bec, Chat, Tim, and Gemma. Bec and I went out for a surf together in penang penang. We had a shakey start but then managing to get a few waves and even rode some together.
      Despite getting a case of Bali belly and having to spend a day in bed, I was grateful for the restful time  and to be in an amazing villa. I was sad the trip was only a short one and I'm excited to head back some time soon`,
